Got it. Below is a compact, self-contained explanation that does not rely on your local file paths. I also included a practical database schema at the end.

How the System Works
Core Concepts
Page: A CMS entity with title, content, slug, and status. A Page may point to a visual Template via template_id. Pages and their main fields are translatable.
Template: A JSON-defined layout built from drag-and-drop Blocks. Templates are also translatable (separate title and 
content
 per language).
Block: A PHP class with:
Metadata and settings (the “options” fed to the editor form).
A 
content(model)
 renderer for frontend HTML.
A 
preview(model)
 for live editor preview.
Some blocks are containers (hold children), e.g., Root, Row, Column. Others are leaf/content blocks (e.g., Text).
SEO: Pages expose an SEO form in admin. SEO entries are linked to the Page (per language when applicable) and rendered in the frontend head section.
Admin Workflow
Create or edit a Page:
Set title, status, optional WYSIWYG content, featured image, etc.
Fill SEO fields in the built-in SEO meta section.
Click “Template Builder” to visually compose the page with blocks.
Open Template Builder:
If the Page has no Template, a Template is created and linked automatically.
You enter the Live Editor (drag-and-drop + inline settings).
Build with blocks:
Pick blocks from the palette. Drag to the canvas/layers.
Click a block to edit its settings (auto-generated form based on the block’s options).
Save → persists the Template JSON.
Result on frontend:
If a Page has a Template, the Template is processed into HTML and rendered.
If not, the Page falls back to its WYSIWYG content.
Live Editor (Drag-and-Drop) Mechanics
Block registry: All available blocks are discovered and registered at runtime from core modules, plugins, and the active theme.
Block palette: Grouped by category (e.g., “Layout”, “Content”, “Theme”). Searchable.
Canvas/layers: The template is a tree with a ROOT node as the root container.
Selection & settings: Selecting a block shows a dynamic form auto-built from the block’s options (field types, defaults, labels).
Preview: The editor posts the current node’s model to a preview endpoint; the block’s 
preview()
 or 
content()
 returns HTML for the iframe.
Save: Persists the entire template JSON (the block graph).
Template JSON Structure (V2)
Nodes: Each node is { id, type, model, nodes[], parent, component, name }.
ROOT: The root container with children referencing top-level layout blocks (typically Rows).
Model: Arbitrary key-value data specific to the block (e.g., text content, classes, padding).
Validation/enrichment: When loading/saving, the system validates block types, injects defaults from block settings, and can add preview HTML.
Rendering Pipeline (Frontend)
Page decides: If template_id exists, render the template. Otherwise render Page content.
Template processing:
Collect the block classes (registry).
Parse the Template JSON into a tree.
Depth-first render from ROOT. For each node:
Find the block class by type.
Call 
content(model)
 to get HTML.
Container blocks call 
children()
 to render their descendants.
SEO: The controller prepares SEO meta data (optionally language-aware) and passes it to your layout head.
Block Design
Base contract:
getName()
: human-readable name in the editor.
getOptions()
: metadata for the editor:
Category and icon.
is_container flag (whether it can have children).
settings describing the form fields (types, labels, defaults).
content(model)
: returns HTML (often from a Blade view or template).
preview(model)
: optional optimized HTML for live editor.
Container blocks: e.g., Root, Row, Column. They render structure and call 
children()
 to render nested nodes.
Content blocks: e.g., Text, Card, Hero, etc. They render actual content using their model fields.
Registration:
Core/module/theme providers register blocks by mapping a block key (type) to its PHP class.
The registry is aggregated from all sources at runtime.
Reuse:
You can add the same block type multiple times with different model values.
You can export/import entire Templates to reuse across environments.
Duplicating a Page typically clones its Template and translations.
SEO Integration
In admin: The Page edit screen includes a standard SEO form (title, description, image, canonical, etc.).
In frontend: The Page’s controller computes SEO meta for the current language and injects it into the layout (head tags).
Cloning: When a Page is cloned, the system also clones associated Template and SEO entries.
Sitemap: Pages are added to the sitemap via a helper integrated into the module provider.
Extending the System
Create a new block:
Implement a PHP class extending the block base.
Provide 
getOptions()
 with fields and defaults.
Implement 
content(model)
 and a simple view template.
Register the class in a provider so it appears in the palette.
Theming:
Themes can add or hide blocks via their provider and register theme-specific blocks (e.g., Subscribe, Features, Hero).
Localization:
Both Page and Template (title, content JSON) are translatable. The live editor supports switching languages during editing.
Database Schema
Note: Exact naming may vary, but these structures reflect how the system works. Use/adjust to your naming conventions. Includes soft deletes and common indexes.

Quick Summary
Pages point to Templates; Templates are JSON block trees.
The drag-and-drop builder edits that JSON via a block registry.
Rendering walks the JSON and calls each block’s renderer.
SEO is managed per-page (and optionally per-locale) and injected into the frontend head.
You extend the system by adding new block classes, views, and registering them so they appear in the builder.
